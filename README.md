# 🏫 CMCS Web Application

## 📖 Overview

The **Claim Management and Coordination System (CMCS)** is a web-based platform built with **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **Entity Framework Core** to streamline and manage lecturer claim submissions at an academic institution.  
The system enables **Lecturers** to submit and track claims, while **Coordinators** and **Managers** can review, approve, reject, or hold claims for further evaluation.

CMCS provides a clear workflow for claim management, status tracking, and reporting through a modern and responsive web interface styled with **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🧾 Claim Workflow

1. **Lecturer** logs in and submits a claim.  
2. **Claim** is stored in the database with status = `Pending`.  
3. **Coordinator** reviews and changes status to `Approved`, `Rejected`, or keeps it `Pending`.  
4. **Manager** has oversight and can review all processed claims.  
5. **Reports page** displays claim statistics for transparency.
